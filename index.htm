Veenus: Cool. How to get 3D points? It is a discussion about
methods to scan 3D. 

Stereoscopic imaging is the simple way to sense 3D. It is
same as the way brain senses 3D from our eyes. All the one you need is two
webcams with proper overlapped frustum. Correlate the same physical points on
the two views that you get. The vision libraries such as OpenCV
will give you aids.
