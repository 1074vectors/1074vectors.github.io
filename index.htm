3D programming make sense! When it deals with huge data, it's interesting too. <strong>1074 Vectors</strong> - The interactive 3D graphics expertize homes here. <strong>You</strong> are welcome as a reader, an eithusiast, a collaborator or as a business man.
<br><br>
<h1>/ home </h1><br>
We love the evolution of interactive 3D graphics. 3D programming always had a glorious fancy part and an engineering part. It's been challenging to keep performance with required accuracy. How we balance the usage of memory to reduce repeated computing? When it mixes with distributed nature and capacity of the new generation head-end devices, it can be again challenging. Engineering always serves the purpose well, any artistic rendering will be neglected. But without a good combination of colors and effects a good software will not please users.
<br><br>
From Da-Vinci days itself, architecting plays an important role to beautify engineering for an artistic purpose. Architecting is not just engineering its very close to art. 
<br><br>
We do business because of passion in 3D graphics. See business link...
<br><br>
All companies have weak part in their SWOT charts. Our point to mention is schedule constraints. We have strict privacy handling strategy to protect our customer's intellectual interests. The side effect is we heavily depend on the people we have. So book your engagement period before hand. But always feel free to talk… we are happy to hear you. 
<br><br>
<h1>/ business </h1><br>
<h3>/ engagement Models</h3><br>
We do programing for behind the screen technologies of interactive computer graphics. More than coding, this include technology selection, architecting and after deployment support based on the queries/issues specific on platform considerations.
<br><br> 
We only work on outcome based contracts rather than time & material contracts. We start our engagement in two ways with a potential customer.
<br><br>
1.	Proposal <br><br>
2.	Technical analysis report & estimate<br><br>
<br><br>
Proposals are unpaid. Depending on clarity of the solution and complexity of target hardware and input data, a proposal can have a ball park estimate both in terms of time and price. As our expertise is normally engaged, scheduling for a proposal takes time. So this unpaid method is apt for those who have time and R&D mindset. 
<br><br>
Technical Analysis report with estimation are paid engagements though its output is not fully charged. Analysis report will give whether the project is feasible or not. The functional specification stage which follows this, gives clarity on the features of the solution. We have a history of 86% success rate on estimate and technology selection. The rest had requirement revamping during the course of the time. Depending on the complexity, the price ranges from 3000 USD to 30,000 USD. Suggest industrialists to start with this engagement model as estimates are accurate compared to ballpark.

<h3>/ privacy</h3> <br>
Privacy is very important for each one of us. Like that we honor other's privacy too. 
<br><br>
Our privacy strategy is very systematic and secure which is matured. First of all our core engineering staff is perfectly knew each other for last 20+ years. The core team will not pass any information without declassification to mathematics or art team even if it is a necessity. The declassification process is strategically our trade secret. Though we cannot give much light on that, in brief it is based on term mangling. Hard cipher systems are too poor compared to secrecy handling of a human brain. We have a process and practices which is matured over years. But bonding between core members are our value.
<br><br>
Since the declassification not just a law point of view, the receivers cannot even identify the product that they have contributed after its full development. Surely it's a protected by law too.
<br><br>
Sometimes it's hard for us as a company too when it comes to showcasing us. But marketing of a quality first team is not just that needed. You know! 
<br><br>
Another business impact is the execution. We normally prefer to keep privacy with trusted team. Also to keep quality we need to stick with that then too our 68% projects were delivered on time. Surely our privacy policy not that economical to us as we are taking projects on turnkey basis.

<h1>/ thoughts </h1><br>
Professional 3D is not a single aspect. These thoughts will definitely give you a new dimension.
<br><br>
<h3>How your program can read 3D? </h3><br>
It is a discussion about methods to scan 3D.
<br>
Stereoscopic imaging is the simple way to sense 3D. It is same as the way brain senses 3D from our eyes. All the one you need is two webcams with proper overlapped frustum. Correlate the same physical points on the two views that you get...

<br><br>
<h3>3D in memory </h3><br>
Usually storing in memory is a challenge for professional 3D applications. What is the simple way is keep a set of points? Each with 3 position values. That is x,yand z. just a keep a list of points. It is the most natural way of memory representation.  
<br><br>
But this thumb rule is not actually always practical. Based on the nature of the data...

<h3>Chalenges in 3D editing </h3><br>
It was always been difficult to interact with 3D models on a computer screen as it is just a 2D space and the sense of depth is provided using the perspective display method. One can easily understand the movement of an object in the 2 directions aligned with the sides of the screen; be it of the mouse pointer or any 3D object. But there is no way for the user to identify the movements in the 3rd dimension, which is normally inward and outward of the screen.

<h3>Handling the target GPU (generations of GPUs) </h3><br>
yet to publish>>
<br><br>
<h3>How to be faster with Multi-GPU </h3><br>
In the terminologies of the 90’s, there is a classic term calld co-processor who assist the cpu for certain specialized jobs. GPUs are co-processors in that definition. But in 2016, GPUs far more than just assistants. It is powerful than CPUs.  It is true for both ends: an entry level PC with a discrete graphics card to a professional graphics workstation. In all cases it gives more FLOPS (floating point operations per second) for each $ you pay.

<h1>/ join </h1><br>
We welcome challenge loving programmers to our fleet.
<br><br>
>Falling in love is a must! Yes... 3D love is our first criteria.
<br><br>
> Sense in 3D. With a white board or piece of paper, it's hard to communicate 3D with full sense. Only indications that we can draw or talk. Right? Yea.. then you got it.
<br><br>
> You may be good in JS or openGL ES. We agree that you are expert too. But in 1074 vectors, we love close-to-metal programming knowledge. We call it knowledge about system architecture, c programming knowledge, network stack knowledge, processor architecture or simply under-the-hood programmer knowledge!
<br><br>
>Be connected. How well is always good. We want you to learn seamlessly. Be abreast.
<br><br>
>Travel friendly...? good.. not just go and talk. But we want you to respect global cultures.
<br><br>
Last... but  very important: We <strong>trust</strong> you and you <strong>trust</strong> us. Please have a look at business/privacy in the web page. That is our commitment to the world. If you are ready for that professional life based on <strong>trust</strong>, you are eligible for joining us. Even if you don't join us too... we respect you. :)
