<p>3D programming always had an artistic part and a precise engineering part. </p>
<p>Let us talk about engineering first. It's been challenging to retain quality of 3D without losing accuracy and performance. How to reduce repeated computing to improve performance? Simple! Store some results. It’s a balance between Memory usage vs Computing for a better performance. This old theory is grabbing new attention nowadays. With the distributed nature and low-capacity of the new generation head-end devices, new parameters are evolving and balancing different aspects has become more challenging. As batteries are involved, the metrics like quality/watt and quality/degree-Celsius too need to be considered. As the FLOPS/$ for computing can be split between local and cloud enabled internet/intranet resources, the load division between them too is another point of consideration. In a nutshell, a good engineering solution cannot be achieved by tuning a single aspect alone.</p>
<p>Much about the engineering aspects! Even though engineering always serves the purpose well, it does not consider the artistic quality. From Da-Vinci days itself, architecting plays an important role in beautifying engineering for artistic purpose. Architecting is not just engineering; it stands somewhere between engineering and art. Without a good combination of colors and effects, software can not impress users. For a good 3D software demands a good <strong> architecture</strong> to deliver pleasing its users and for utilizing the quality engineering behind it. </p>
<p>At 1074Vectors, we love to deliver the artistic aspects excellently. For that, our engineering team do the best under the hood of these excellent screens. We do architect not just engineer the 3D solutions.</p>

<p><strong>Important Note:-</strong></p>
<p>All companies have a weakness to point out in their SWOT charts. Ours is constraints on schedule vs availability of good man-power. Yes. It’s a point to consider as it is connected with schedule constraints. It is also directly connected with our strengths: QoS and Privacy handling. We have strict privacy handling strategy so as to protect our customer’s intellectual interests. As it is very well known, only people with good quality can keep privacy intact. The side effect is, we heavily depend on the core people we have. So book your engagement period beforehand. But always feel free to talk… we are happy to hear you. </p>

<h3>/ engagement models</h3><br>
<p>
We do programming. Specializes in “behind the screen technologies” of interactive graphics. More than coding, our job includes technology selection, architecting and technical support after deployment. Normally the technical support is provided against queries specific to certain hardware platforms (eg:- GPU). </p>
<p>
Global Software development is not that easy. Especially when it comes to 3D. Our ‘e’ medias still has a lot to grow in communicating subjects around 3D. In this scenario, it’s not that easy to start an engagement that will result in a win-win situation.
</p> <p>
We value our time and that of our clients too. We value the money budgeted for the project. Hence we do ‘outcome’ based model of business (a.k.a turnkey contracts). There is no man power discussions as we value the result than charging for man-hours. However still… to start any development it is important to know the volume initially itself.
</p> <p>
We adopt two methods to START the engagement. One is unpaid, while the other is marginally charged.</p> <p>
1.     Proposal  (unpaid)</p> <p>
2.     Technical analysis report & estimate</p> <p>
Proposals: Proposals are executed for a first level review of the requirements in a technology context. Obviously it will propose a solution in a document. It will have technology details and rough understanding of the requirements. It may also include a ball park estimate. It depends on the clarity of the solution, the complexity of targeted hardware and known varieties of input data. As our experts are normally engaged, scheduling for a proposal may take time. So this unpaid method is apt for those who have flexibility in time-to-market. </p> <p>
Technical Analysis report with estimation: A document is delivered which contains a proposed solution with refined requirements, Technology selection, project schedule and a price estimate. Project will have an FS stage (functional specification stage) after this. This stage gives clarity on the features of the solution. But Technical analysis report is made after testing the potentially risky areas. Though the features are not fully formed, normally we can expect a good success rate, which is around 86% for us. The rest had requirement revamping during the course of the time. Depending on the complexity, the price ranges from 3000 USD to 30,000 USD.</p>

<p><strong>Which model is apt?</strong> For an industrialist, it is better to start with the latter engagement model as the estimates here are accurate than a mere ballpark. This will help in proper budgeting which may again need to plan cash-flow. Though this is a paid method, the value of the report is not fully charged as we are also considering things in a start-up mind-set. After all, the success of this report is the beginning of a wonderful industrial product. If you are just seeking for a possibility of a solution for an initial planning as an academic exercise, first method is sufficient though the schedule is bit unpredictable.</p>

<h3 id="PRIVACY">/ privacy</h3> <br>
<p>
Hard cipher systems are too poor compared to secrecy handling of a human brain! 1074 Vector’s privacy strategy is very systematic and matured. First of all, our core engineering team perfectly knows each other for last 20+ years. Each engagement is interfaced by one from the core team. The core team members are collectively responsible for offering the solution. The core team do not pass any information without declassification to other teams. Means the mathematics or art team will only be knowing a part of the problem space. The declassification process is strategically our trade secret. Though we cannot give much light on that, in brief, it is based on terminology-mangling. We have process and practices which are matured over years. Surely, the bonding among the core team members is the key in keeping the privacy strategy as a business pitch.
</p>
<p>Since the declassification is not just in a law point of view, the receivers cannot even identify the product to which they have contributed.</p>
<p>Business impact of this privacy strategy is in the execution. The trusted core team’s planned availability and mitigation of unplanned absences, are always a bottleneck for a smoother execution. Thus our privacy strategy is not that economical to us when a team member needs an unplanned leave. Partly it is because of our turnkey engagement model. However 7 out of 10 projects are always on time.</p>

<h1>/ thoughts </h1><br>
Professional 3D is not a single aspect. These thoughts will definitely give you a new dimension.
<br><br>
<h3>How your program can read 3D? </h3><br>
It is a discussion about methods to scan 3D.
<br>
Stereoscopic imaging is the simple way to sense 3D. It is same as the way brain senses 3D from our eyes. All the one you need is two webcams with proper overlapped frustum. Correlate the same physical points on the two views that you get...

<br><br>
<h3>3D in memory </h3><br>
Usually storing in memory is a challenge for professional 3D applications. What is the simple way is keep a set of points? Each with 3 position values. That is x,yand z. just a keep a list of points. It is the most natural way of memory representation.
<br><br>
But this thumb rule is not actually always practical. Based on the nature of the data...

<h3>Challenges in 3D editing </h3><br>
It was always been difficult to interact with 3D models on a computer screen as it is just a 2D space and the sense of depth is provided using the perspective display method. One can easily understand the movement of an object in the 2 directions aligned with the sides of the screen; be it of the mouse pointer or any 3D object. But there is no way for the user to identify the movements in the 3rd dimension, which is normally inward and outward of the screen.

<h3>Choice of 3D Programming APIs </h3><br>
There are only a few options when it comes to programming in 3D. While Microsoft is promoting DirectX and Apple promoting Metal, there is a huge fan base for Open GL too which is an open specification driven by the Khronos group. Of course, the popularity of Open GL is because of its cross-platform support. While the DirectX...

<h3>How to be faster with Multi-GPU </h3><br>
In the terminologies of the 90’s, there is a classic term calld co-processor who assist the cpu for certain specialized jobs. GPUs are co-processors in that definition. But in 2016, GPUs far more than just assistants. It is powerful than CPUs.  It is true for both ends: an entry level PC with a discrete graphics card to a professional graphics workstation. In all cases it gives more FLOPS (floating point operations per second) for each $ you pay.

<h3>Handling the target GPU  </h3><br>
<p>We have had a few interesting experiences when we handled different GPU generations. Its quite amazing and risky that if we do program 3D screeens without considering those aspects. However it varies over time. Yet to publish this article. </p>
