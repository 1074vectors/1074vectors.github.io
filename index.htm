<p>3D programming makes sense! When it deals with huge data visualization, it's interesting too. <strong>1074 Vectors</strong> - The interactive 3D graphics expertize homes here. <strong>You</strong> are welcome as a reader, an enthusiast, a collaborator or as a product owner. 3D rendered screens will be the natural way to provide information from the data that you have!.

<p>We love the evolution of interactive 3D graphics. 3D programming always had a glorious fancy part and an engineering part. It's been challenging to keep quality of 3D with accuracy and performance. How we balance the usage of memory to reduce repeated computing? When it mixes with distributed nature and capacity of the new generation head-end devices, it can be again challenging. Engineering always serves the purpose well, any artistic rendering will be neglected. But without a good combination of colors and effects a good software will not please users.</p>
<p>We love the evolution of interactive 3D graphics. 3D programming always had a glorious/fancy part and an precise engineering part. It's been challenging to keep quality of 3D with accuracy and performance. How to reduce repeated computing? Simple! Store. It’s a balance. Memory vs computing for performance. This old theory getting a couple of possibilities nowadays. It mixes with the distributed nature and low-capacity of the new generation head-end devices, it can be again challenging. Since battery involved, quality/watt, quality/degree Celsius etc kind of metrics also evolved. Also the computing can be split in cloud enabled internet/intranet for a FLOPS/$. So running cost is another metrics. Altogether a good engineering solution is not one aspect of tuning up. </p>
<p>Much about engineering aspects! Engineering always serves the purpose well, any artistic rendering will be neglected. Without a good combination of colors and effects a good software will not please/impress her users. From Da-Vinci days itself, <strong>architecting</strong> plays an important role to beautify engineering for an artistic purpose. Architecting is not just engineering its very close to art. </p>
<p>We love to deliver the artistic aspects excellently while our engineers do the best under the hood. We do architect not just engineer.</p>
<p>To know more about doing a business taking support from us, see our /business link.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note:-</strong></p> 
<p>All companies have a weak part to point out in their SWOT charts. Ours is constraints on schedule vs availability of good man-power. Yes. It’s a point to mention as it connects with schedule constraints. At the same time, it is directly connected with our strongest points: QoS and Privacy handling. We have strict privacy handling strategy to protect our customer’s intellectual interests. As very well known, only good quality people can keep privacy intact. The side effect is we heavily depend on the core people we have. So book your engagement period beforehand. But always feel free to talk… we are happy to hear you. </p>
<h1>/ business </h1><br>
<h3>/ engagement models</h3><br>
<p>
We do programming. Specializes in “behind the screen technologies” of interactive graphics. More than coding, our job includes technology selection, architecting and technical support after deployment. Normally the technical support is done against queries specific to certain hardware platforms (eg:- GPU). 
</p> <p>
Software development around the globe is not that easy. Especially when it comes to 3D. Our ‘e’ medias are still a lot of grow to communicate subjects around 3D. At this scenario, it’s not that easy to start an engagement in a win-win model. 
</p> <p>
We value our time and clients too. We value money budgeted for the project. So we do ‘outcome’ based model of business (a.k.a turnkey contracts). There is no man power discussions as we value the result than charging man-hours. However still… to start a development it is very unclear to arrive to an estimate at the starting point.  
</p> <p>
So two methods are generally adopted to START. One is unpaid; the other is marginally charged.</p> <p>
1.	Proposal  (unpaid)</p> <p>
2.	Technical analysis report & estimate</p> <p>
Proposals: Proposals are executed for a first level review of the requirements in a technology context. Obviously it will propose a solution in a document. It will have technology details and rough understanding of the requirements. It can have a ball park estimate. It depends on the clarity of the solution, the complexity of targeted hardware and known varieties of input data. As our experts are normally engaged, scheduling for a proposal may take time. So this unpaid method is apt for those who have time to plan for a time-to-market. </p> <p>
Technical Analysis report with estimation: A document is delivered. It contains a proposed solution with refined requirements, Technology selection, project schedule and a price estimates. Project will have a FS stage (functional specification stage) after this. The FS stage gives clarity on the features of the solution. But Technical analysis report is made after testing the potentially risky areas. Though the features are not fully formed, normally we can expect a success rate We have a history of 86% success rate on estimate and technology selection. The rest had requirement revamping during the course of the time. Depending on the complexity, the price ranges from 3000 USD to 30,000 USD. Suggest industrialists to start with this engagement model as estimates are accurate than a mere ballpark. This will help in proper budgeting which may again need to plan cash-flow. Though this is a paid method, the value of the report is not fully charged as we are also considering things in a start-up mindset. After all the success of this report is start of a wonderful industrial product. </p>

<h3>/ privacy</h3> <br>
Privacy is very important for each one of us. Like that we honor other's privacy too. 
<br><br>
Our privacy strategy is very systematic and secure which is matured. First of all our core engineering staff is perfectly knew each other for last 20+ years. The core team will not pass any information without declassification to mathematics or art team even if it is a necessity. The declassification process is strategically our trade secret. Though we cannot give much light on that, in brief it is based on term mangling. Hard cipher systems are too poor compared to secrecy handling of a human brain. We have a process and practices which is matured over years. But bonding between core members are our value.
<br><br>
Since the declassification not just a law point of view, the receivers cannot even identify the product that they have contributed after its full development. Surely it's a protected by law too.
<br><br>
Sometimes it's hard for us as a company too when it comes to showcasing us. But marketing of a quality first team is not just that needed. You know! 
<br><br>
Another business impact is the execution. We normally prefer to keep privacy with trusted team. Also to keep quality we need to stick with that then too our 68% projects were delivered on time. Surely our privacy policy not that economical to us as we are taking projects on turnkey basis.

<h1>/ thoughts </h1><br>
Professional 3D is not a single aspect. These thoughts will definitely give you a new dimension.
<br><br>
<h3>How your program can read 3D? </h3><br>
It is a discussion about methods to scan 3D.
<br>
Stereoscopic imaging is the simple way to sense 3D. It is same as the way brain senses 3D from our eyes. All the one you need is two webcams with proper overlapped frustum. Correlate the same physical points on the two views that you get...

<br><br>
<h3>3D in memory </h3><br>
Usually storing in memory is a challenge for professional 3D applications. What is the simple way is keep a set of points? Each with 3 position values. That is x,yand z. just a keep a list of points. It is the most natural way of memory representation.  
<br><br>
But this thumb rule is not actually always practical. Based on the nature of the data...

<h3>Challenges in 3D editing </h3><br>
It was always been difficult to interact with 3D models on a computer screen as it is just a 2D space and the sense of depth is provided using the perspective display method. One can easily understand the movement of an object in the 2 directions aligned with the sides of the screen; be it of the mouse pointer or any 3D object. But there is no way for the user to identify the movements in the 3rd dimension, which is normally inward and outward of the screen.

<h3>Choice of 3D Programming APIs </h3><br>
There are only a few options when it comes to programming in 3D. While Microsoft is promoting DirectX and Apple promoting Metal, there is a huge fan base for Open GL too which is an open specification driven by the Khronos group. Of course, the popularity of Open GL is because of its cross-platform support. While the DirectX...

<h3>Handling the target GPU (generations of GPUs) </h3><br>

<br><br>
<h3>How to be faster with Multi-GPU </h3><br>
In the terminologies of the 90’s, there is a classic term calld co-processor who assist the cpu for certain specialized jobs. GPUs are co-processors in that definition. But in 2016, GPUs far more than just assistants. It is powerful than CPUs.  It is true for both ends: an entry level PC with a discrete graphics card to a professional graphics workstation. In all cases it gives more FLOPS (floating point operations per second) for each $ you pay.
