<h1> Challenges in 3D Editing </h1>
<br><br>
<p>Well, it was always been difficult to interact with 3D models on a computer screen as it is just a 2D space and the sense of depth is provided using the perspective display method. One can easily understand the movement of an object in the 2 directions aligned with the sides of the screen; be it of the mouse pointer or any 3D object. But there is no way for the user to identify the movements in the 3rd dimension, which is normally inward and outward of the screen. I mean, we can understand whether the object is moving out or in when using perspective view. But we can’t really identify its position relative to others in the same scene without knowing the comparative size of these objects.  So, the problem is, we can’t place an object at the exact position where we want in the virtual world.</p>
<p>Historically, this problem was tackled using plane based editing. I mean, like editing in 3 different views like top, front and side (or axial, coronal and sagittal views as they use in medical field). To place the object correctly, the user will be switching between all these three views and it gets really difficult. Even though much research is taking place in this area, nothing has come close to providing a practical affordable solution. </p>
<p>Of course, we have 3D mouse available, with which we can get some control over 3D gestures, but still they are not as natural as 2D editing when it comes to free form editing. There are methods like silhouette based editing for giving better control over 3D editing. Silhouette editing is where the user draws a 2D sketch near a silhouette of the 3D object in screen to show how the object needs to be transformed. I mean the user shows how the new silhouette should look like by drawing a free hand sketch. The software then decides how the mesh needs to be transformed so that the new silhouette matches the sketch. I, having developed similar tool in past, am aware how difficult it is to both develop and use such a feature. But with some practice and patience, we will be able to get good results in 3D Editing with it. Also there are tools which supports clay-modelling like features, which comes handy in creating nice-looking 3D shapes. </p>
