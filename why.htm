   <p>Privacy is very important for each one of us. Like that we honor other’s privacy too.</p>

<p>Our privacy strategy is very systematic and secure which is matured. First of all our core engineering staff is perfectly knew each other for last 20+ years. The core team will not pass any information without declassification to mathematics or art team even if it is a necessity. The declassification process is strategically our trade secret. Though we cannot give much light on that, in brief it is based on term mangling. Hard cipher systems are too poor compared to secrecy handling of a human brain. We have a process and practices which is matured over years. But bonding between core members are our value.</p>

<p>Since the declassification not just a law point of view, the receivers cannot even identify the product that they have contributed after its full development. Surely it’s a protected by law too.</p>

<p>Sometimes it’s hard for us as a company too when it comes to showcasing us. But marketing of a quality first team is not just that needed. You know!</p>

<p>Another business impact is the execution. We normally prefer to keep privacy with trusted team. Also to keep quality we need to stick with that then too our 68% projects were delivered on time. Surely our privacy policy not that economical to us as we are taking projects on turnkey basis.</p>
